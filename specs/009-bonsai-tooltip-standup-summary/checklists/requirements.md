- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- FR-008's clarification is resolved: the Standup Summary scope is today's not-yet-archived batch of work — completed tasks (with notes) plus currently open tasks (briefly, title only) — not a history across archived days. Reflected in FR-008/FR-008a and the Assumptions section.
- All checklist items pass. Ready for `/speckit-clarify` (recommended, to probe remaining UX/edge-case ambiguities) or `/speckit-plan`.
